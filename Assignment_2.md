# Measuring Advertising Synergies 

The following text is a short summary of the full report written for a school project
about measuring advertising effectiveness and synergies.

## Introduction

This report explores the effect of online advertising and flyers both in isolation and combined
marketing channels. The experiment is set up by distributing firm-related flyers to one region
and measuring taking measurements of this region and a comparable region. Also, For both
of these groups, either firm ads or charity ads were displayed. The study employs a single
independent variable of dichotomous nature, that is ‘Sale’, which can take on either a 0 or a 1
in the data model. The report is therefore centered around predicting the likelihood of a sale.
Data for a total of seven exogeneous variables are gathered across a sample of 20,000
individuals. These variables are: Flyer_region, Firm_ad, Ad_seen, Amount_ads, Sale,
Gender, Age, Existing_customer.

## Results

Firstly, we found that flyers are more effective in making a positive difference in conversion
rates than online firm ads. A nuance to this is that flyers likely cost more to distribute and
produce and therefore are limited in terms of reach. 

Secondly, we find that there is a synergy between firm ads and flyers. The combination of both instruments results in a higher
conversion rate than the isolated effects of both instruments in sum. This synergy is basically
‘free’ revenue for a manager since it doesn’t require any direct additional costs. 

Thirdly, we discovered that individuals who either chose to or weren’t able to view online ads of any kind
(be it firm or unrelated charity ads), are inherently different in terms of conversion rates -
which are significantly lower -than those who have viewed at least one ad. A marketing manager should try to 
avoid this group as they may just not have a tendency to buy online,
regardless of the deals and ads you throw their way. 

Fourthly, we found that the impact of ads is higher for new customers as opposed to existing customers. Fifthly, we produced evidence 
that the overall effect of incremental ads (1 to 10) per individual increases per additional ad.
However, the significant incremental impact of advertisements per individual on conversion
rate decreases and flat-lines at about the fourth ad. A manager should consider limiting the
amount of ads per individual to a maximum of about four to get the most out of his budget.
Lastly, individuals who are female are more likely to purchase. Also, younger individuals
have a higher likelihood of purchase.

## Closing Remarks

An interesting topic of future research for the online retailer would be to investigate the
revenue per individual as well as record the amount of repurchases. We think this would
enhance the manager’s capacity to make accurate decisions about budget allocations and
applications of the marketing instruments in order to meet the objectives as it allows for
return on investment and customer lifetime value calculations. Also, recording data for longer
than two months could give us more insights into the potential indirect effects of advertising,
which are often overseen by managers.
