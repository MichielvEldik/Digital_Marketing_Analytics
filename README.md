# R_DigitalMarketingAnalytics_Assignment_1

This report explores the effect of online advertising and flyers both in isolation and combined
marketing channels. The experiment is set up by distributing firm-related flyers to one region
and measuring taking measurements of this region and a comparable region. Also, For both
of these groups, either firm ads or charity ads were displayed. The study employs a single
independent variable of dichotomous nature, that is ‘Sale’, which can take on either a 0 or a 1
in the data model. The report is therefore centered around predicting the likelihood of a sale.
Data for a total of seven exogeneous variables are gathered across a sample of 20,000
individuals. These variables are: Flyer_region, Firm_ad, Ad_seen, Amount_ads, Sale,
Gender, Age, Existing_customer.
